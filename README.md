# Slim CMS

Slim CMS is a simple Content Management System based on the [Slim Framework](https://github.com/codeguy/Slim).

I'm building it in the first place for my own projects and it's still messy, but feel free to play around with it. 

# Installation

1. Download files or clone this Github repo.
2. Ensure that the content folder permissions are set to 0777.
3. Navigate to: yoursite.com/cms and fill in required information
